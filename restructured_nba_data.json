            "On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.",
            "[10] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers.",
            "Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League (ABL) and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities.",
            "During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters.",
            "For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title.",
            "Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.",

            "In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including Maurice Podoloff as president.",
            "[11] To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own.",
            "It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.",
            "[12]\n\nThe new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,[13] as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories.",
            "In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1954–55, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Milwaukee Hawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which remain in the league today, although the latter six all did eventually relocate.",
            "The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities.",
            "The Hawks had shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and later shifted to St. Louis in 1955.",

            "[15][16] Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,[15][17] but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel \"Sweetwater\" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols.",
            "During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty.",

            "Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single-game records in scoring (100) and rebounding (55).",

            "The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.",
            "[22]\n\nThrough this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers, and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta, as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises.",
            "The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards) became the ninth NBA team in 1961.",

            "The leagues engaged in a bidding war.",
            "[23][24] The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor).",
            "However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees—Norm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.",
            "[25]\n\nIn 1969, Alan Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's.",
            "It incorporates the silhouette of Jerry West, based on a photo by Wen Roberts.",
            "The NBA would not confirm that a particular player was used because, according to Siegel, \"They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it.",
            "It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player.\"",
            "The logo debuted in 1971 (with a small change to the typeface on the NBA wordmark in 2017) and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.",
            "[26]\n\nThe ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires, in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates.",

            "In 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met Dallas lawyer Doug Adkins and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to Dallas.",
            "Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, Home Interiors and Gifts owner Don Carter.",
            "Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at Duncanville High School.",
            "Simultaneously, Buffalo Braves president and general manager Norm Sonju developed an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise.",
            "While the Braves went to California as the San Diego Clippers, Sonju eventually returned to Texas.",
            "He was introduced to Carter by Mayor Robert Folsom, one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, which moved to San Antonio in 1973 becoming the San Antonio Spurs.",
            "Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the Milwaukee Bucks and the Kansas City Kings, but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an expansion team.",
            "The league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and Houston Rockets.",
            "The 1978–79 season was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent).",
            "Still, during the 1979 NBA All-Star Game weekend, NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien announced the league would add two new teams in the 1980–81 season, with teams in Dallas and Minneapolis.",
            "Once the potential Minnesota owners backed out, only Dallas remained.",
            "(The Minnesota Timberwolves would not join until 1989.)",
            "Through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner David Stern, the expansion fee was settled on $12.5 million.",
            "Carter would provide half the amount.",
            "[10][11]\n\nAt the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957–1962 TV western Maverick; the fans chose the title with 4,600 postcards received, beating Wranglers and Express.",
            "[12][13] James Garner, who played the title character, was a member of the ownership group.",
            "[14] The University of Texas at Arlington, who also uses the Mavericks nickname, had objections about a shared name but did not attempt any legal action.",
            "[15] They joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference, where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004–05 season.",
            "Dick Motta, who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977–78, was hired as the team's first head coach.",
            "The Mavs drafted Kiki VanDeWeghe of UCLA with the 11th pick of the 1980 NBA draft.",
            "Still, VanDeWeghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into its inaugural season.",
            "VanDeWeghe was traded to the Denver Nuggets, along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into Rolando Blackman in 1981, and Sam Vincent in 1985.",
            "In the Mavericks debut game, taking place in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103–92.",
            "But the Mavs started the season with a 6–40 record on their way to finishing 15–67.",
            "However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a significant role in the early years of their franchise.",
            "Journeyman 6 ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavericks in December after a scout watched a game with Davis.",
            "He had to be convinced to play for the team rather than attend to his studies at the University of Maryland (which he was funding by playing for Anchorage).",
            "[16] He would play for the remainder of the season after joining in December.",
            "Davis would spend the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually, his number 15 jersey was retired.",
            "The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a good debut season, with 7,789 spectators per game.",
            "[17]\n\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team.",

            "Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas.",
            "But it was Jay Vincent who made the most significant difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors.",
            "The Mavericks improved to 28–54, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the Utah Jazz."

            "They could not sustain that momentum and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.",
            "But the Mavs' 38–44 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season.",
            "Mark Aguirre led the 1982–83 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA.",
            "Jay Vincent and Rolando Blackman contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively.",

            "The 6 ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists.",
            "The Mavericks' in 1983–84 posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43–39 and second in the Midwest Division.",
            "The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history.",
            "Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game—second in the league to Utah's Adrian Dantley.",
            "Dallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip, they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in five games.",
            "The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at Moody Coliseum, as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks was hosting a tennis tournament.",
            "The Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers, were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one.",
            "But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984 because they owned Cleveland's first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall.",
            "The Mavs used it to select forward-center Sam Perkins, a former North Carolina Tar Heel, with a surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.",
            "About this time, the Dallas Cowboys, once one of the NFL's elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1–15 in 1989.",
            "The Mavs were hitting their stride simultaneously and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex's most popular team.",
            "The 1984–85 team finished a game better than the previous year at 44–38.",
            "Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, Sam Perkins made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game.",
            "The Mavs returned to the playoffs in 1985 but were not as successful as they had been.",
            "They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the Portland Trail Blazers in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.",
            "Dallas had the eighth pick in the 1985 NBA draft—again due to a trade with the Cavaliers—and drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf out of Washington.",
            "He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential.",
            "The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson, who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991–92 season.",
            "This trade allowed the Mavericks to have a steady hand at the center position lacking throughout the franchise's first five years.",
            "In 1988, James Donaldson became the first Dallas Mavericks center in club history to be selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game.",
            "Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1986 NBA All-Star Game, hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena.",

            "They defeated Utah three games to one in the first round.",
            "In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the Lakers again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games.",
            "But four of those games were decided by four points or fewer, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season.",
            "The Mavs drafted Michigan center Roy Tarpley with the seventh overall pick, who would become a very talented—but troubled—member of the roster.",
            "The 1986–87 Mavericks team had their most successful regular season to date, going 55–27 and winning their first Midwest Division title.",
            "But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs.",
            "After hammering the Seattle SuperSonics by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing to Game 4 in Seattle.",
            "Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach.",
            "John MacLeod, who had led the Phoenix Suns to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons, including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.",
            "The 1987–88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season—finishing 53–29 and losing their Midwest Division title to the Denver Nuggets—but it was another successful year for the team.",
            "Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point.",
            "Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds.",
            "The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date.",
            "They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals.",
            "The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle.",
            "Still, in the end, the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.",
            "Despite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention.",
            "However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured patella tendon on March 10, 1989, and missed the rest of the season.",
            "The Mavericks were left understaffed, demoralized, and disheartened as they finished with a 38–44 record.",
            "It was their first losing season since 1982–83—which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.",
            "The Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989–90 with a 47–35 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos.",
            "On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest.",
            "The team started 5–6, and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato.",
            "The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games.",

            "The players they managed to acquire—Rodney McCray, Fat Lever, and Alex English—were all in the twilight of their careers.",
            "On November 9, it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own, which ended his season.",
            "The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28–54, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic.",
            "In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA.",
            "It got even worse in 1991–92.",

            "The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete.",
            "The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury.",
            "Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season—hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks.",
            "The team finished with a 22–60 record.",
            "In 1992–93, the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman—who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer—to the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick.",

            "The Mavericks started 2–27 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with Gar Heard.",
            "The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9–73 by the 1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers).",
            "But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7–14 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finishing 11–71, the second-worst record in NBA history.",
            "Dallas selected Kentucky forward Jamal Mashburn with the fourth overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft and hired Quinn Buckner as head coach.",
            "Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, Bobby Knight, who told Buckner that the only way he would succeed with the Mavs would be to run the team with an iron hand.",
            "[18] The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style and started 1–23.",
            "By the end of January, they were 3–40, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league.",
            "But 5–9 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13–69.",
            "It was still the worst record in the league by far, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record.",
            "However, they did tie the NBA's single-season record for consecutive losses at 20 games (since broken).",
            "Buckner was fired at the end of the season despite having a five-year contract.",
            "However, Carter decided that Buckner had \"burned too many bridges\" due to his autocratic coaching style.",
            "[18] He compiled the worst record for a rookie NBA head coach, a record that only lasted four years until Bill Hanzlik broke it with the Denver Nuggets.",
            "The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons.",
            "The Mavericks also wound up with the number two pick in the 1994 NBA draft and picked up Cal point guard Jason Kidd, giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn, and Kidd, known as \"The Three Js.\"",
            "The addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in 1994–95.",

            "George McCloud, who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat.",
            "McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.",

            "[56][57] With Thomas unable to compete at full strength, the Pistons narrowly fell in Game 7, 108–105, as the Lakers became the first back-to-back NBA Champions since the 1969 Boston Celtics.",

            "The city, expecting to lose the NFL's Los Angeles Rams (who relocated to St. Louis in 1995 for 21 seasons, before moving back to Los Angeles in 2016), was looking for a new professional team and began courting the Clippers, who struggled to carve out an identity competing against the popular Lakers for audience share.",
            "From 1994 to 1999, the Clippers played several games annually (usually five to eight regular-season games a season, and an annual preseason game) at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, sharing the venue with the NHL's Ducks and the Splash indoor soccer team.",
            "Clippers games regularly drew a much-higher average attendance per game at the Pond than when the team played its home games at their regular venue, the Los Angeles Sports Arena; the Anaheim games proved so popular that many Clippers players and much of the fan base, as well as the NBA, wanted to the team to stay in what was considered at the time a state-of-the-art arena.",
            "[citation needed] For instance, between 1994 and 1997, the Clippers drew an average of nearly 16,000 fans per game at the Pond, while in Los Angeles, they drew in the neighborhood of 9,200 per home game.",
            "[33] Anaheim officials and the Clippers had had on-going talks about moving to Anaheim full-time years before the Pond was eventually built,[34] as Donald Sterling was pursuing options to play elsewhere in the Los Angeles metropolitan region if there was not a replacement for the Sports Arena being built.",
            "The Clippers, however, nearly moved to Anaheim permanently in time for the 1996–97 season, but according to a Los Angeles Times article published in June 1996,[35] owner Donald Sterling turned down a deal that would have paid the team $95 million over 12 years.",
            "Odgen Corporation, who at the time managed the Pond, and the city of Anaheim offered the Clippers a multi-tiered deal that would have included upwards of $33 million paid to the team over the first six years of their Pond agreement, plus other monies allocated towards new locker rooms, team offices, and a practice facility.",
            "In another related Times article,[36] Odgen and Sterling were in talks to have the management company take care of the Clippers' day-to-day operations for a $4 million a year fee.",
            "Also at the time, the Walt Disney Company, owners of the Ducks and Anaheim Angels baseball team during that period, were pursuing at least a partial ownership of the Clippers, with the key element being that its game telecasts would be part of a planned ESPN regional network for Southern California.",
            "However, as the planned ESPN West network never came to reality, all three teams had continued to maintain broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket.",
            "This remained a sticking point in any deal to relocate to Anaheim, eventually leaving the team to remain in Los Angeles.",
            "On the court, the Clippers continued to make frequent roster changes throughout this particular period, which only resulted in one playoff appearance under Fitch.",
            "Along with Loy Vaught, a collection of young players (including Lamond Murray, Eric Piatkowski, and Lorenzen Wright), and journeyman veterans (among them Pooh Richardson, Tony Massenburg, Rodney Rogers, Darrick Martin, and Brian Williams), the Fitch-coached teams during this particular era struggled mightily, although they did make the playoffs once during this time.",
            "The 1996–97 team made the playoffs with a losing record (36–46) and were swept in the first round by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Utah Jazz, three games to none.",
            "Four members of the 1996–97 squad are now deceased.",
            "Malik Sealy died in a car accident in 2000, Kevin Duckworth died of heart disease in 2008, Lorenzen Wright went missing and was murdered in 2010, and Dwayne Schintzius died from cancer complications in 2012.",
            "Two other players from the Fitch era suffered tragic circumstances of their own; Brian Williams (who played for the Clippers during the 1995–96 season, and later became known as Bison Dele) was believed to have been murdered by his brother while the two were vacationing in 2002 while in the South Pacific, and Rodney Rogers became paralyzed after a dirt bike crash in 2008 in his native North Carolina.",
            "[37]\n\nIn December, Vaught, the team's leading scorer for the past three seasons, had season-ending back surgery.",
            "Without Vaught, the Clippers finished 17–65, the third-worst record in the league.",
            "Fitch was fired after the 1997–98 season (and later sued the team to recover the remaining money on his contract), and was replaced by one of his proteges, former Celtics and Bucks coach Chris Ford.",
            "Meanwhile, Vaught's career as a Clipper was effectively finished, as he left as a free agent after that season, and signed with the Detroit Pistons; at the time of his departure, he was the franchise's all-time rebounds leader with 4,471 (a number that was later surpassed by Elton Brand, with 4,710).",
            "[38]\n\nThe Clippers won the first overall pick in the 1998 Draft Lottery and selected center Michael Olowokandi from University of the Pacific.",
            "The team had a 0–17 start and finished with a 9–41 record in the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season.",
            "They were led by second-year forward Maurice Taylor, who averaged 16.8 points per game, and won the fourth overall pick in the following draft, which coincided with their move to the Staples Center.",
            "The Clippers would draft Lamar Odom, and then hired former All-Star (and Los Angeles native) Dennis Johnson as an assistant coach, as well as Hall of Fame former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to help tutor Olowokandi during his second-year.",
            "Johnson remained an assistant coach until the middle of the 2002–03 season, when he took over as head coach.",
            "Abdul-Jabbar remained only one season, detailing a lack of improvement in Olowokandi, who is largely considered one of the biggest draft busts in league history.",
            "During the 1999 off-season, Rodney Rogers signed with the Phoenix Suns.",
            "The Clippers also sent Lamond Murray to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman.",
            "However, Newman was then traded to the New Jersey Nets for Eric Murdock a month later without ever playing a game for the Clippers.",
            "The team finished with the worst record in the league (15–67) in the 1999–2000 season, while the Lakers had the best record that year (67–15), and won the NBA championship.",
            "In what was supposed to be a counter-move, the Coliseum Commission, the management entity that managed the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and Coliseum, had planned to build a new 18,700-seat arena in the parking lot next to the Sports Arena that would have cost up to $94 million, that would have included 1,100 club seats, 84 luxury suites, and an on-site practice facility for the Clippers.",
            "However, those plans were scuttled once planning for Staples Center (two miles directly up the street from the Sports Arena) were taking place, and the Clippers decided to become a tenant at Staples.",
            "[citation needed]\n\nIn 1999, the Clippers joined the Lakers and Los Angeles Kings in the new Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles.",
            "[39] In sharing the building with other tenants, such as the more popular Lakers, the Clippers, with relatively low success, were often overshadowed.",
            "[citation needed] Also, because of the terms of its leasing agreement with Staples Center, the Kings and Lakers had scheduling priority over the Clippers, with the Clippers taking whatever dates that were available, including scheduling same-day Clipper-Laker and Clipper-King doubleheaders.",
            "However, in the years after, the Clippers' scheduling at Staples Center became gradually more favorable (especially given the popularity of the team in recent years) in their lease renewals in 2004 and 2013, with the team receiving increased profits, including more of a share of luxury suite and concession revenue.",
            "Since February 2011, the Clippers have sold out every regular season and postseason home game, behind the popularity of stars Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul.",

            "The team became popular among fans with its high-flying style of basketball and the Clippers did improve slightly, registering a 31–51 record.",

            "To improve upon the previous season, the Clippers acquired high-scoring and rebounding power forward Elton Brand from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tyson Chandler.",

            "In order to seriously challenge for playoff contention in 2003, the franchise traded Miles to the Cavaliers for Andre Miller, who led the NBA in assists in 2001–02 with 11 per game.",
            "With a seasoned point guard in Miller, Lamar Odom at small forward, one of the league's best power forwards in Brand, and center Olowokandi, as well as having the best supporting cast in the league, the Clippers threatened a potential playoff run.",
            "However, poor team chemistry and injuries (the Clippers lost 293 man-games to injury), they finished with a disappointing 27–55 record.",
            "Coach Alvin Gentry was also replaced, with Dennis Johnson entering midway through the 2002–03 season.",
            "After the dismal season prior, the team lost several of its core players, with Miller, Odom, Olowakandi, and forward Eric Piatkowski (who was one of the longest-tenured players in franchise history)[40] departing via free agency prior to the 2003–04 season.",
            "The team opted to retain Brand and Maggette with long-term contracts.",

            "They also finished with a better record than the Lakers for the second straight year.",
            "By finishing sixth in the Western Conference, with a record of 47–35 (their highest finish since the team left Buffalo), they benefited from the current NBA playoff format of regular-season records taking precedence over winning the division, and secured home court advantage over the Denver Nuggets.",

            "Some of their failure was attributable to misfortunes such as the career-altering car crash suffered by promising point guard Bobby Hurley in 1993, and the suicide of Ricky Berry during the 1989 off-season; some was attributed to poor management such as the long tenure of head coach Garry St. Jean and the selection of \"Never Nervous\" Pervis Ellison with the first overall pick in the 1989 NBA draft.",

            "Despite Williams's often spectacular play, the Kings had grown tired of his recklessness and turnovers; Bibby would provide much more stability and control at the point guard position.",
            "This move was complemented by the re-signing of Webber to a maximum-salary contract, securing their superstar long term.",

            "After easily winning their first two playoff matchups against the Stockton and Malone-led Jazz and the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks, respectively, the Kings went on to play the archrival and two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, regarded as one of the greatest playoff matchups in history.",
            "In a controversial series,[36] the Kings lost in seven games, one game away from what would have been the first NBA Finals and a chance at the first professional sports championship in Sacramento history.",

            "Many commentators and journalists would question the decisions made by the referees during game 6, specifically that the Lakers were awarded a staggering 27 free throws in the fourth quarter, many of which came from what were in retrospect proved to be no-calls.",
            "[37] Following game 6 even print newspapers began to question the legitimacy of the game.",
            "Most notably, the New York Post ran a front cover with a headline entitled \"Foul Play\"; it also published a related article suggesting that the game was rigged.",
            "[38][39] NBA analyst David Aldridge (then working for ESPN) spoke on the game:\n\nThe 2002 Western Conference finals left many fans wondering whether the Kings could have gone on to win a title, and debate would continue for many years after the events of the series.",

            "He returned mid-season in 2003–04 a season in which the Kings were seeking another chance to avenge their playoff loss to the Lakers, but without his quickness and athleticism, which had been the focal point of his style of play, it was not the same.",
            "Despite that, the Kings still managed to defeat the Mavericks in the first round and after winning game 1 against the Kevin Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round, the Kings appeared to be on the brink of their second Western Conference Finals berth in three years, but the Kings ended the season with a defeat to the Timberwolves in a seven-game series.",

            "Steve Nash used this move often, and Chris Webber is famed for using this move down in the paint."

        "Give and go": [
            "\"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score.",
            "This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball.",
            "This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball."
        ],
        "Dribble pitch (handoff)": [
            "The dribble pitch (or the handoff) is an offensive play whereby the ball-handler passes to a player (often a bigger player) and runs by them to collect the ball, whilst the big sets a screen."
        ],
        "Pick and roll": [
            "A pick and roll is an offensive play in which a player stops to screen (block) a defender for the teammate handling the ball and then slips behind the defender to accept a pass as the handler makes a move towards the basket.",
            "In the NBA, John Stockton and Karl Malone were a quintessential pick and roll tandem and used this play to great effect in the 1990s.",
            "Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire proved to be extremely effective at the pick and roll throughout the 2000s.",
            "Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Blake Griffin, and Chris Paul were considered among the best contemporary pick and roll tandems.",
            "From the initial position of the pick-and-roll maneuver, the player who receives the ball has many different options as to whether they pass it, or fake and then go for a jump shot.",
            "These variations typically include the pick and pop, where by the roll man instead of heading to the basket trails behind and is wide open for a jumper, hence the 'pop', as well as slipping the screen, whereby the defender of the screener attempts to cheat and get ahead of the screener, at which point the screener does not set a screen, but merely slips by, leaving them open as their defender trails behind."
        ],
        "Backdoor": [
            "A backdoor play is when a player without the ball gets behind the defense and receives a pass for an easy score.",
            "This can be executed if the defenders are unaware of the open space behind them.",
            "Also, when a defender strongly commits on defense (e.g.",
            "tries to steal or deny a pass), they are vulnerable to a backdoor play."
        ],
        "Alley-oop": [
            "An alley-oop is an offensive play which involves one teammate lofting the ball up near the rim in anticipation of another teammate jumping up to catch and dunk it.",
            "Because this move requires both teammates to know what the other is thinking, the alley-oop is a rare and exciting play.",
            "The alley-oop first dates back to the mid-1950s when K. C. Jones and Bill Russell teamed up to perform it while they were college teammates.",
            "[11][12]  Point guard Chris Paul, and big men Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, were known for their spectacular alley-oops; during their shared time with the Los Angeles Clippers their team earned the name \"Lob City\".",
            "Another notable duo known for using this play is LeBron James and Dwyane Wade during their time at the Miami Heat."

        "Pass and chase": [
            "Pass and chase is when a player passes the ball to another teammate and immediately follows the pass to either pick and roll, slip by, accept a handoff back, or other basketball moves."
